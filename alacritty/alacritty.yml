# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut

#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart

    # When set to `None`, URL launching will be disabled completely.

    # URL modifiers
    #
    # These are the modifiers that need to be held down for opening URLs when clicking
    # on them. The available modifiers are documented in the key binding section.
    #modifiers: None

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings)
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. For example, this is the
# default paste binding:
#
# `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
#
# Each key binding will specify a:
#
# - `key`: Identifier of the key pressed
#
#    - A-Z
#    - F1-F24
#    - Key0-Key9
#
#    A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#    https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
#    Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
#    the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
#    decimal number. This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes
#    for certain keys:
#
#       `showkey --scancodes`.
#
# Then exactly one of:
#
# - `chars`: Send a byte sequence to the running application
#
#    The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#    it possible to pass escape sequences. To find escape codes for bindings
#    like `PageUp` (`"\x1b[5~"`), you can run the command `showkey -a` outside
#    of tmux. Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back
#    to keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when changing an
#    escape sequence.
#
# - `action`: Execute a predefined action
#
#   - Copy
#   - Paste
#   - PasteSelection
#   - IncreaseFontSize
#   - DecreaseFontSize
#   - ResetFontSize
#   - ScrollPageUp
#   - ScrollPageDown
#   - ScrollLineUp
#   - ScrollLineDown
#   - ScrollToTop
#   - ScrollToBottom
#   - ClearHistory
#   - Hide
#   - Minimize
#   - Quit
#   - ToggleFullscreen
#   - SpawnNewInstance
#   - ClearLogNotice
#   - ReceiveChar
#   - None
#
#   (macOS only):
#   - ToggleSimpleFullscreen: Enters fullscreen without occupying another space
#
# - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
#
#    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
#    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
#       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
#
#    - Command
#    - Control
#    - Option
#    - Super
#    - Shift
#    - Alt
#
#    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
#       `mods: Control|Shift`.
#    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
#
# - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
#
#    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
#    when in different modes.
#
#    - AppCursor
#    - AppKeypad
#    - Alt
#
#    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
#    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
